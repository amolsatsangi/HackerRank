# HackerRank Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges and problems from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard). I have solved problems across different domains and in multiple programming languages.

## Overview

The repository is organized by problem categories and the programming languages used for solving the challenges. Each solution demonstrates the use of different algorithms, data structures, and language-specific features.


## Languages Used

- **C**
- **Python**
- **Java**
- **Other Languages** (as I continue to expand my knowledge and solve problems in new languages)

## How to Use

You can clone this repository to your local machine and browse through the solutions. Each directory corresponds to a category (e.g., Algorithms, Data Structures), and within each, solutions are grouped by the programming language.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amolsatsangi/HackerRank.git
cd HackerRank
```

## Running the Code

Depending on the language used, hereâ€™s how to compile and run the code:

For C solutions:

```bash
gcc -o output problem1_solution.c
./output
```

For Python solutions:

```bash
python3 problem1_solution.py
```

For Java solutions:

```bash
javac problem1_solution.java
java problem1_solution
```
